## Project Description
Add an initial Project description here. There is no requirement for the length of the proposal. A paragraph or two may be enough -- just to get an idea of what you might want to work on. 

For the revised project description, we will ask you to be more precise and think about how the entire project can be divided up into individual pieces or modules. It's useful to start thinkign about this now.

## Requirements 
If there are any hardware, software, or online services you think you are going to need, please list them in the Requirements section. This can be tentative for the initial proposal and the teaching staff can help identify resources.

## Milestones 
Not required for the initial proposal. Complete this section for the revised proposal.
