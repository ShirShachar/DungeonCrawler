## Project Description
Add an initial Project description here. There is no requirement for the length of the proposal. A paragraph or two may be enough -- just to get an idea of what you might want to work on. 

for my final project, I’m building a game called Dungeon Delver, inspired by classic rogue-lite dungeon crawlers. The idea is to create a simple top-down dungeon exploration game where the player explores procedurally generated levels, fights off enemies, and collects useful items to survive and get stronger.

-> The dungeons will be randomly generated every time, so no two runs are the same. (so random will be used in here)

-> The game will start off text-based to get the core mechanics right — things like moving around,
generating dungeon layouts, and combat. Once that’s working, I plan to build a basic 2D version using Pygame, so there’s a visual interface with a grid-based map and simple character sprites.

-> The game will contain files of diffrente classes (for the play, for the enemies and for the grid) 

For the revised project description, we will ask you to be more precise and think about how the entire project can be divided up into individual pieces or modules. It's useful to start thinkign about this now.

## Requirements 
If there are any hardware, software, or online services you think you are going to need, please list them in the Requirements section. This can be tentative for the initial proposal and the teaching staff can help identify resources.

-> Pygame


## Milestones 
Milestone 1 - initial code, making sure it is working in the terminal (play.py)
Milestone 2 - adding a pygame file
Milestone 3 - adding features
