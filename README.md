**Dungeon Delver**

## Project Overview**
Dungeon Delver is a top-down, rogue-lite dungeon exploration game inspired by classic dungeon crawlers. Players explore procedurally generated levels, battle enemies, and collect items to survive and grow stronger with each run. Every dungeon layout is unique, offering a new challenge each time.

The project is being developed in two stages:
Stage 1: Core game mechanics (movement, dungeon generation, combat) are implemented in a text-based version to focus on logic and gameplay systems.
Stage 2: A 2D visual version is built using Pygame, featuring a grid-based map and simple character sprites.

The codebase is modular, with separate classes for the player, enemies, and dungeon grid to support clean design and easy future expansion.

## Features
1. Randomly generated dungeon layouts
2. Basic combat system
3. Item collection and player upgrades
4. Simple 2D grid-based visual interface (Pygame)
5. Modular code structure for scalability

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame

## Development Roadmap
Milestone 1: Initial text-based version completed (movement, combat, procedural generation).
Milestone 2: Basic 2D Pygame implementation (grid, player and enemy sprites).
Milestone 3: Additional features: new enemy types, item system, enhanced procedural generation, UI improvements.
